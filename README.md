# Simple Wordle Game
In this project, you are tasked with creating a command-line game in Go that mimics the popular Wordle. The user will guess a hidden word, and your program will provide feedback on their guesses.

## The Situation
The player must guess a 5-letter word. The game provides feedback on how close each guess is to the secret word.
